# NLP-tasks

There are 7 natural language processing (NLP) experimental tasks, with the first three tasks based on statistical learning, and the remaining four tasks based on deep learning. However, the datasets are not included here, so you need to download them on your own.

## lab1

Lab 1 involves using a Bayesian classifier for binary and multiclass classification.

```python
python BayesClassifier.py
```

## lab2 

Lab 2 involves using Hidden Markov Models for word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.

```python
python HMM.py
```

## lab3 

Lab 3 involves using Conditional Random Fields for part-of-speech tagging.

## lab4

Lab 4 involves using TextCNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for text classification.

```python
python train.py
```

## lab5

Lab 5 involves using BiLSTM_CRF (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with Conditional Random Fields) for part-of-speech tagging.

```python
python train.py
```

## lab6

Lab 6 involves using BERT for text classification.


```python
python train.py
```

## lab7 

Lab 7 involves using Transformer for machine translation.


```python
python train.py
```
